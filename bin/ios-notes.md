Write a really good plan before generating a task. Refactoring takes forever.

Be aware that writing to many tests make things slow.

Probably smart to run both the build and tests in the loop and print to file, so we use the same simulator every time.
Then a new session can process the logs and fix issues.

Really great to fix errors with Xcode's calude integration.

Dont make the tasks way to small, then everything takes forever.

Dont run the UI tests with code.
