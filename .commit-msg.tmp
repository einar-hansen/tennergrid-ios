Add comprehensive unit tests for PuzzleGenerator.generatePuzzle method

Completed task: Write unit tests ensuring generated puzzles are valid and solvable (Phase 1.3)

Added 24 new test methods covering:
- Puzzle generation for various grid sizes (minimum, maximum, typical)
- All difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, expert)
- Invalid dimension handling
- Deterministic generation with seeds (for daily puzzles)
- Verification that generated puzzles:
  - Are structurally valid (correct dimensions, value ranges)
  - Have solutions that follow all Tenner Grid rules (no adjacent duplicates, no row duplicates)
  - Column sums match target sums
  - Initial grids match solutions
  - Have unique solutions
  - Are solvable by the PuzzleSolver
- Performance testing for small and large grids
- Multi-generation validation ensuring consistency

Helper methods added:
- verifyCompleteSolution: Validates solution structure and value ranges
- verifyPuzzleHasEmptyCells: Ensures puzzle has appropriate empty cells
- verifyPuzzleIsSolvable: Confirms puzzle can be solved and solution matches

All tests follow Given-When-Then pattern with clear assertions.
